## What makes our website the best for your brokerage?
Our websites are built differently than how a lot of agencies deliver to their clients. Most real estate sites through large agencies like Agent Image are built through Wordpress. However, Wordpress is no longer the popular platform it once use to be. With new web development tools on the market, we make sure your business gets the most modern design and tools to grow your real estate brokerage website.

Hungry Ram focuses on a no database website, meaning your site will become a fortress to malicious malware and hacks. Which also means that your site will last longer than the 3 year web industry standard on how often a website should be updated. Why did we take this approach on a no database website? Because we've had years of experince in various large agencies with hacked websites, slow load times, and limited customization. Ready to get started? Get in touch with a designer!
