  questions.
general_faq:
- answer: Your site is built on the new JAMstack architecture. Meaning your site will
    be a fortress, unlike others on WordPress. Our sites are built to last!
  question: How long will my site last?
- answer: After launching your website, we will already set up Google Analytics and
    send it to Google for indexing. This is the most we could do organically other
    than updating tags.
  question: How do I boost my SEO
- answer: Yes, even though your site will be optimized for search engines, it can
    take a while for the bots to crawl your website, especially if it's new. This
    can vary from site to site and can take weeks or months.
  question: Does your site have SEO
- answer: Yes! If you're having difficulty writing your own content for the website,
    we can definitely be flexible.
  question: Can someone help with content?
- answer: Yup! Every project will have it's own preview link that you can access anytime!
  question: Can I see the design while you build?
- answer: No, everything is built in California. We have amazing connections in California
    for videography who has worked filmed for UFC and experienced marketers.

  question: Do you service out of state?
- answer: Our website is the most secure website you could get. Included with SSL
    security.
  question: Is my website secured?
- answer: Almost all websites nowadays rely on databases. Meaning when you type in
    information and click "save", it gets stored in a database. Having a database
    makes your site vulnerable to malicious attacks and spam. Our website powers on
    read-only files, meaning no vulnerabilities to hacks. Making it the most secure.
  question: Why are your sites more secure?
- answer: Most agencies rely on WordPress or page builders. All websites (except e-commerce)
    is built using JAMstack - a modern web development architecture for developers/programmers
    to build modern, fast, secure web apps.
  question: How are your websites built?
- answer: Web industry standard is to update every 2-3 years. Our sites are built
    to last way over the recommended time frame.
  question: How often should I update my site?
- answer: Yes! Every website should be mobile responsive now. There should be no excuse!
    Google will always rank mobile responsiveness higher. This provides a user-friendly
    experience.
  question: Are your websites mobile responsive?
real_estate_faq:
- answer: Subscriptions are month-to-month. You are able to cancel at any time. Website
    set up is based on the proposal.
  question: Are there any contracts?
- answer: A templated design may take a week to fully launch the website. Custom designs
    can take up to 2-3 weeks.
  question: How long till I could get my real estate website?
- answer: An amazing site is useless without promotion. The more you market your website,
    Google will see that more people are visiting and will eventually rank you higher.
    Put it on your business cards, social media, etc.
  question: Will I get lots of leads?
- answer: IDX grabs data from the MLS and displays it. There are tools that come with
    the IDX, such as lead management, listings manager, and more. Without IDX, it's
    a little more work due to manually adding in listings.
  question: What is IDX? Do I need it?
- answer: The website is built on a proprietary  system. You could own the content,
    but the site will need to be maintained with us.
  question: Do you host the website
- answer: Yes! Most agencies never customize their admin for clients because it will
    update globally for everyone. Depending on the feature, it's very likely it can
    be built out. For example, a client needed a "featured community". we were able
    to build out custom page templates that draw in communities he added in the admin.
  question: If I don't see a feature in the admin, are you able to build it out?
- answer: Agents and brokers have their own type of sites, especially if IDX is needed.
    IDX will always be the more expensive option due to fees on the data feed, and
    charges from your MLS. Please get in touch with us to find out an accurate price.
  question: What determines my monthly cost?
small_business_faq:
- answer: No! Small businesses should not work off of templates since you're trying
    to brand yourself. We do not want a corporate design on a friendly food site.
  question: Would my website be a template?
- answer: 'Yes, Shopify is the #1 e-commerce platform out there and provides all the
    tools needed. Other platforms for e-commerce tend to be more difficult. If Shopify
    is not within your price range, we can definitely recommend other platforms.'
  question: Do you only build ecommerce on Shopify?
- answer: Any type of website is supported. However, everyone has a different business
    model and we've informed clients that it's something that can't be done through
    the platform. It's recommended to consult with us. It's free!
  question: What type of business can you help?
- answer: The admin portal can easily be customized to fit your business model. For
    example, adding lists of services, menus, and more!
  question: How flexible is your admin?
- answer: This can vary for everyone. A larger custom site with more pages will take
    longer. A more accurate time frame is 1-3 weeks. This also depends on how fast
    content is provided to move forward with the website.
  question: How long does it take to build a small business website?
