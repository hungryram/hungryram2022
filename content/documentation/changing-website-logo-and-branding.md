Updating your branding and logo is important to ensure that your visitors know who you are. To make changes to your logo and site title, follow the steps below:

1. Under **Profile and Settings**, or **Data**, click on **Settings**.
2. Click on **Appearance**
3. Upload your **logo** and **dark logo**.
4. Upload the favicon to display a small icon on the browser tab.
5. Change the logo width to a specific width that can clearly be visible to your visitors

If only the **Site Title** is entered and not the logo, the site title will be used in place of the logo.

The regular \*\*Logo \*\*field is uploaded to display globally across your entire website.

The **Dark Logo** can be used if you have a darken logo that can be used over a white background. This is useful when the header becomes a white background when scrolling down the webpage.

Uploading your own **favicon** can be important to branding so that way your site can be identified on the browser tab.&nbsp; Take a look at the image below. The favicon should be a small version of your logo, not the full logo. This is usually a symbol or icon.

These icons are displayed within the Google search result page (SERP) too.&nbsp;
