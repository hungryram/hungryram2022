Pho Ha Plus is a franchised restaurant. One of our clients had referred the owner to us and we have been maintaining their website since May of 2021. The old website they had was a WordPress website built entirely of images so it had no text for Google to see.

Once we switched over to the new design, we saw improvements in page speed and SEO. We strengthened the user interface which upgraded the experience when someone landed on the website.
