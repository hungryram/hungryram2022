## Project Overview

Top Marq Media is a full-service content creator for businesses that need help creating videos, content, and growing their social media. The website was originally built through Wix and showed a very low ranking. Top Marq Media wanted a website to showcase their work and understand their full range of services.

## The Solution

As a growing content creator, we wanted to design a website that fits the industry. By providing a more modern design to the website, we are able to decrease the bounce rate on the website by keeping visitors engaged on the website.

Since the website was a secondary marketing tool for Top Marq Media, we focused on adding two main pages to showcase the portfolio - videos and photographs with little content.

The aesthetics of the website was the primary focus and by using subtle animations and minimal design, visitors are able to navigate the site with ease.

## The Result

After the launch of the website, we were able to increase the site speed tremendously by using our [CDN through Netlify](/services/web-hosting). Now the website redesign will make a great impression on visiting customers and leads.
