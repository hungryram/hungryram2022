### Overview

Carly came to me through my website and loved the work I had done. She was originally paying $99/mo for a small business website. We discussed the type of project the site would be and it turned out to be a simple project integrated with a lead generating widget called Vcita.

### The Design

With an interior designing website, I went for a more of an architectural look and feel but also keeping the same design choice for a minimal interior design website. I was able to research into her competitors based off the site they had and the design to be able to produce something better.

### The Result

Carly now has her site ranked first page when searching for interior designers in Fayetteville, Georgia. The site has ranked higher than it has from the previous website she had. Now ranking at 90 for Google Pagespeed.
